# Production Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Backend Production Readiness

Your HMO Property Search application is now fully production-ready with the following improvements:

### üîß Production Fixes Applied

1. **Dynamic Port Binding** - Uses `process.env.PORT` for platform compatibility
2. **Automated Build Path Fix** - Post-build script ensures static files are in correct location
3. **Multi-Platform Support** - Configurations for Vercel, Render, Railway, Heroku, Docker
4. **Environment Detection** - Proper dev/production mode switching
5. **Production Package.json** - Optimized for serverless deployment
6. **Static Asset Serving** - Proper handling in production builds

### üì¶ Build Process

The build now automatically:
- Compiles TypeScript backend to `dist/index.js`
- Builds React frontend to `dist/public/`
- Copies static files to `server/public/` (where production server expects them)
- Creates production-ready package.json
- Verifies all critical files exist

### üöÄ Deployment Options

#### 1. Render (Simple Full-Stack)
**Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && npm run build && mkdir -p server/public && cp -r dist/public/* server/public/
```

#### 2. Vercel (Serverless)
- Automatically detects `vercel.json`
- Configured for Node.js 20.x runtime
- Includes Python dependencies for scraping

#### 3. Railway
- Uses included `railway.toml`
- Auto-deploys from Git
- Built-in health checks

#### 4. Heroku
- Configured with `heroku.json`
- Supports both Node.js and Python buildpacks
- Ready for git push deployment

#### 5. Docker
- Multi-stage Dockerfile included
- Optimized for production
- Health checks configured

### üêç Python Dependencies

Production environments automatically handle:
- Web scraping packages (requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml)
- Selenium for advanced scraping
- Playwright for modern web automation

### ‚úÖ Production Features

- **Real Property Data** - Scrapes from Zoopla & PrimeLocation
- **Financial Analytics** - ROI, yields, cashflow calculations

- **Static Assets** - Proper serving of CSS, JS, images
- **CORS Ready** - Cross-origin request support

### üîç Deployment Verification

After deployment, test:
1. App loads at deployment URL ‚úÖ
2. Property search returns real results ‚úÖ
3. Static assets load properly ‚úÖ
4. API endpoints respond correctly ‚úÖ

Your application is now enterprise-ready for production deployment across any major hosting platform.
