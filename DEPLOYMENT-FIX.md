# Vercel Runtime Error Fix

## Error Fixed:
```
Error: Function Runtimes must have a valid version, for example `now-php@1.0.0`.
```

## Solution Applied:
Updated `vercel.json` to use versioned runtime specification:

### Before:
```json
"use": "@vercel/node"
```

### After:
```json
"use": "@vercel/node@3.0.0"
```

## Root Cause:
Vercel now requires explicit runtime versions for all function builders. The generic `@vercel/node` without a version is deprecated.

## Files Updated:
- `vercel.json` - Main deployment configuration
- `deploy/vercel.json` - Backup deployment configuration

## Deployment Ready:
The application is now ready for Vercel deployment with proper runtime versioning. All other deployment platforms (Render, Railway, Heroku, Docker) remain unaffected.
