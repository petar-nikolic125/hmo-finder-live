# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Ready for Deployment

Your HMO Property Search application is now fully configured for Vercel deployment with these optimizations:

### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **✅ Serverless Function Structure**
   - Created proper `/api` directory with serverless entry point
   - Separated Vercel-specific server configuration
   - Fixed ESM module exports for serverless compatibility

2. **✅ Build Configuration**
   - Custom build script optimized for Vercel
   - Proper static asset handling in `dist/public/`
   - Python scraper files included in deployment

3. **✅ Environment Setup** 
   - Production-ready environment detection
   - Vercel-specific server initialization
   - Proper timeout and connection handling

4. **✅ Static File Serving**
   - Frontend assets built to `dist/public/`
   - Proper routing between API and static files
   - Fallback handling for SPA routing

### Deployment Steps:

1. **Connect to Vercel**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   vercel login
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

### Configuration Files:
- `vercel.json` - Deployment configuration
- `api/index.js` - Serverless function entry
- `build.js` - Custom build script
- `.vercelignore` - Files to exclude from deployment

### Environment Variables:
Set these in your Vercel dashboard if needed:
- `NODE_ENV=production` (automatically set)
- `VERCEL=1` (automatically set)

The application will be available at your Vercel domain with full functionality including:
- ✅ Real-time property scraping
- ✅ Financial analytics
- ✅ Responsive UI
